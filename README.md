# Risk-Aware Vehicular Edge Computing

Independent research implementation of dynamic, risk-aware computation
offloading in vehicular edge networks.

The project will study a learning-based offloading policy built around
QR-DQN and CVaR. The reconstructed game-theoretic method from the base
paper is treated as a comparison baseline, not as the implementation
foundation of this repository.

## Current status

Repository bootstrap only. No scientific model or training algorithm has
been implemented yet. The approved design baseline is documented in:

- [`docs/scientific_model.md`](docs/scientific_model.md): scientific
  assumptions, entities, units, formulas, information lifetime, and metrics;
- [`docs/mdp_specification.md`](docs/mdp_specification.md): observations,
  actions, slot ordering, query lifecycle, CVaR control, fallback, and the
  transition-test matrix.

The first implementation milestone is to formalize:

1. task, user-vehicle, server-vehicle, and MEC entities;
2. the time-slotted dynamic environment;
3. state, action, reward, and terminal conditions;
4. latency, energy, queue, mobility, and channel models;
5. reproducible baseline and learning experiments.

```

## Baseline separation

The base-paper reconstruction remains in its own repository. This project
may reimplement documented equations and baseline behavior with explicit
provenance, but it must not silently depend on or modify that repository.

## Development

The package uses a `src` layout and will target Python 3.11 or newer.
Development commands will be added once the numerical and learning
dependencies are finalized.
